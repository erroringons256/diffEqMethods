# diffEqMethods
A klutzed together Python script using numpy in order to solve arbitrary order ODEs numerically. Implements a few iteration methods.

This was simply written for the purpose of implementing an ODE solver for no reason except me wanting to. Though fully vectorising it in numpy did take some brain gymnastics.

Was written sporadically over the course of a week or two in the latter half of 2021-07.
